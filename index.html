  <h1>Dwarf Hamster: Trial and Error
  </h1>
  <h2>"Well Known" Hamster vs. Dwarf Hamster</h2>
  
  <p> When you think of the word "Hamster" what comes to mind? Do you think of a fluffy orange hamster stuffing its cheeks? This hamster is typically known as the "Teddy Bear" hamster and is the most well known and most common hamster. </p>
  <p>Now on the contrary have you seen a group of hamsters that look like baby hamsters? If so you have seen a dwarf hamster; the smaller species of hamster. There are three dwarf hamster species. There is the Russian Winter White, Russian Campbell, and the Roborovski. Although these tiny little creatures are a lot smaller than a typical Syrian hamster, this does not mean they are easier to care for, if anything they require just as much care or even more than your typical hamster.</p>
  <h3>Notable Differences</h3>
  <li>They are tiny</li>
  <li>They need specialized vets</li>
  <li>They are fast</li>
  <li>Easy to lose track of</li>
  <li>They get themselves into trouble easily</li>
    
  <h3>My Personal Experience</h3>
  <p> I myself currently have a Russian Campbell and Winter White mix named BB, and I also have a Syrian hamster named Linny. While they are both a handful, BB is a lot harder to take care of. About a week after getting my dwarf hamster she got her foot caught on something and was limping, this is because she is a lot tinier than your typical Syrian so it is a lot easier for her to get into trouble. Then I had to go through the trouble of calling over 10 vets to get an emergency appointment, some of them only had one hamster doctor who was not in that day or she had to be a certain weight. After all that trouble I finally found a vet who could look at her. Who was an hour away in Canton. Her first visit cost me 200 dollars and all her follow up appointments costed me $50+ each! Even though I have spent all that money and drove so far she is perfectly fine and healthy.</p>

<p>Hamsters are escape artists, and that is no less true for a dwarf hamster. Don't let their small size fool you, they will bite and climb their way out, and on top of escaping, BB blends in with my carpet, so you literally need a search team to find her. I let my dwarf hamster free roam since she can't have a wheel, I will take my eyes off of her for one second and poof, she has disappeared like Houdini. She'll end up in the room over somehow, and a closed door will not stop her. She can squeeze under the door and escape with ease.</p>
<p>As much of a troublemaker she is and how much of a hole she has put in my wallet she is a very rewarding pet to have and I love her to death.</p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>While these little creatures are a handful they are rewarding pets so here are some tips</p>
